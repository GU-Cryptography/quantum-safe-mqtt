# quantum-safe-mqtt

This repository contains code relevant to my final year project for my Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours). 

## Project Abstract

MQTT is a common communication protocol used in the Internet of Things. The protocol provides no security, and current proposals to add security do not consider the future risk of post-quantum attacks. This is a severe risk, as MQTT is often used in conjunction with private data and critical systems, such as locks, video cameras and sensors so security breaches could have a significant impact. 
The purpose of this project is to investigate potential ways of adding post-quantum-safe authentication security to MQTT.
